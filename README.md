# About
This program  (algorithm) allows you to bundle basic mathematical computations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponential. All these being internally inter-converted to get to a possible precise solution.

It is a simple algorithm which is open to any  (if available) enhancements. It is licensed to be permissive for that.

This algorithm is available in both Python and Javascript -- named as main.py and main.js respectively: they are possible direct translation of one another.
